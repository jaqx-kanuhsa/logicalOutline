#EX) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
one = True
two = False
a = one and two 
print(a)

#1) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.

me = True
him = False
a = me and him
print(a)

#2) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the or operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named b. Print the variable.

three = True
four = False
b = three or four 
print(b)

#3) Make one boolean variable. Put the variable after the not. Store this 
#expression in a variable named c. Print the variable.

c = not 0 == 0
print(c)

#4) Make a logical expression with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

d = 2 =and= 2 
print(d)
